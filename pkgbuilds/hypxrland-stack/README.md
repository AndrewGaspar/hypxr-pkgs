# HypXRland runtime stack

This meta-package installs the parallel HypXRland compositor, its matching
control client, patched WiVRn server, voice daemon and base English model, HUD,
VA-API decode gate, and background renderer. It does not replace Arch's stock
Hyprland compositor or the normal Omarchy session.

Install `hypxrland-omarchy` for the complete Omarchy integration and the
**Omarchy XR** display-manager session. Then run:

```bash
omarchy-setup-hypxrland
```

The command creates `~/.config/hypr/hyprland-xr.conf` only when it is absent.
The session refuses to start without a readable config and never falls through
to the normal Omarchy configuration.

WiVRn pairing, GPU/render-node selection, and device-specific runtime settings
remain per-user state. The XREAL-specific `monado-xreal` package is optional.
